    "This shouldn't come up if you think about the problem as aiming for only one of the messages to print, but if you ever find yourself comparing two strings, there is one other thing to note -- when applied to strings, the comparison operators in Python (<, >, <=, >=) are actually comparing the unicode point numbers for corresponding pairs of characters from each string from left to right (i.e. the 0th index character from varA is compared to the 0th index character from varB).
